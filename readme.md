UNED Paint is a software that I developed from scratch for my Degree Final Project.
The objective of this project is to create a raster image editor called UNED Paint.
The program has implemented some of the basic functionality that you would expect from
other existing mordern editors allowing us to create digital art with certain fluidity and
precision or to simply modify images using various pixel manipulation tools. The most
important features are the brush tool used in freehand painting, image layering, importing
& exporting images, saving & loading projects.
Beign a modern image editor it was absolutely necessary to design it in such way that it
could support touchscreens and digital pens. This was achieved by creating a suitable
user interface in order to simplify the workflow.
One other important aspect that we considered is the internationalization and the possibility of adding new languages with ease. Currently the program is translated to English
and Spanish.
The editor was created using various open-source technologies the most important one
being Godot, the engine that powers UNED Paint.


Most of the button svgs were extracted from Krita and Blender (both well known open source projects) and modified to fit the theme.
